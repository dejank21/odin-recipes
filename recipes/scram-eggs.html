        <h2 class="subtitle">Description</h2>
            <p>These Boursin scrambled eggs, silky smooth with a subtle savory flavor, are what I like to make for breakfast or brunch when we have overnight friends or family visiting. We enjoy them served with saut√©ed mushrooms and sliced tomatoes on the side.<p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 large eggs</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons half-and-half</li>
                <li>1 pinch salt, plus more to taste</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons garlic and fine herbs, spreadable cheese.</li>
                <li>Freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>Chopped fresh parsley or chives, for garnish</li>
            </ul>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk eggs, half-and-half, and a pinch of salt together in a small bowl.</li>
                <li>Melt butter in a medium nonstick pan over medium-low heat. When butter starts to bubble, pour in egg mixture. Using a silicone spatula, gently swirl the eggs around in circles from the outside in, without stopping, until you start to see small curds.</li>
                <li>Switch from making circles to making long sweeps across the pan until you see larger curds. When eggs are about 75% cooked, gently fold in cheese. The eggs now should be softly set and still a little runny in places.</li>
                <li>Remove the skillet from the heat, and set aside till it cooks to your preferred consistency.</li>
                <li>Garnish with parsley or chives, and serve immediately</li>
            </ol>
