        <h2 class="subtitle">Description</h2>
            <p>For this lazy French onion soup, onions caramelize in the oven, with only intermittent stirring. Toasted baguette and bubbly broiled Gruy√®re cheese finish the soup.</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 yellow onions, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>3 thyme sprigs, plus leaves for garnish</li>
                <li>1/4 cup dry sherry</li>
                <li>6 cups beef broth</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 fresh or dried bay leaf</li>
                <li>2 teaspoon apple cider vinegar</li>
                <li>12 slices French bread loaf or other soft baguette, lightly toasted</li>
                <li>8 ounces Gruyere cheese, shredded</li>
            </ul>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) with rack in the middle position</li>
                <img src="../images/soup-s1.jpg" alt="A variety of ingredients">
                <li>Combine onions, oil, and thyme sprigs in a heavy-bottomed pot or large Dutch oven.</li>
                <img src="../images/soup-s2.jpg" alt="A pot filled with onions and seasoning">
                <li>Bake, covered, in the preheated oven, stirring once halfway through, until onions are wilted and lightly browned, about 40 minutes. Uncover and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until onions are golden brown and caramelized.</li>
                <li>Remove from oven and stir in sherry. Cook over medium, stirring constantly, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom and sides of pot, until liquid has mostly evaporated.</li>

                <li>Stir in broth, Worcestershire, pepper, salt, and bay leaf; bring to a boil over high. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, undisturbed, allowing flavors to meld together, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in cider vinegar. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf.</li>
                <img src="../images/soup-s5.jpg" alt="A pot full of brown liquid">
                <li>Increase oven temperature to broil. Ladle soup evenly into 6 broiler-proof bowls or crocks, and place the bowls on a large rimmed baking sheet. Top each bowl with 2 bread slices and about 1/3 cup Gruyere.</li>

                <li>Broil until Gruyere is bubbly and the bread is browned in places. Garnish with thyme leaves and serve immediately.</li>
